## Principles
- Full-time student; goals should not destroy health or grades.
- Prioritize depth over box-ticking if there's a conflict.

## 2026 Goals

### CS
- [ ] Maintain Codeforces 1600+ for 3 contests or touch 1700+.
- [ ] Solve 900 problems on LC and codeforces combined.

### Projects / building
- [ ] Ship 2 public projects that each have at least 20 recurring users (or equivalent: 20 servers using a bot, 20 people in a Discord, 20 active installs).
- [ ] Get to 100+ total GitHub stars across your repos (clamp already contributes here).

### Career / external signal
- [ ] Land one strong internship or research position (AI infra / systems / quant adjacent).
- [ ] Have one notable external validation: hackathon prize, accepted talk/post, fellowship, or a widely shared technical blog post.

### Miscellaneous
- [ ] Reach 150 WPM on 60s typing tests with proper technique.
