# 2026 Goals

## Academic & Competitive Benchmarks
- CSE 351: Target 4.0. Focus on deep understanding of how software interacts with hardware and memory.
- Codeforces: Target 1600 Rating (Expert). Demonstrate strong problem-solving speed and algorithmic efficiency.
- GPA: Maintain 3.85+ to stay competitive for high-level systems and quantitative roles.

## Key Projects

- **Slab Allocator / Limit Order Book (LOB) [C]:**
  - A custom memory management system designed for speed and efficiency.
  - Positioned as a high-frequency trading tool optimized for ultra-low latency.
  - Demonstrates the ability to outperform standard system memory allocation in specific use cases.

- **TinyInfer [C++]:**
  - An independent large language model execution engine built from scratch for llama3 architecture.
  - Prioritizes high throughput and efficient batch processing.
  - Focuses on direct control over memory and data flow without relying on heavy external libraries.

- **TinyDist [C++]:**
  - An extension of the inference engine to work across multiple networked computers.
  - Focuses on maximizing data transfer speeds and scaling performance across a cluster.

- **VerDB [Rust]:**
  - A high-performance, asynchronous key-value storage system.
  - Optimized for high-throughput, write-heavy workloads like market data recording or AI logging.
  - Focuses on maximizing data ingestion speeds by utilizing modern asynchronous disk I/O techniques.
